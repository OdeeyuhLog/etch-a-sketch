# etch-a-sketch

A web application simulation a real life etch-a-sketch and its basic mechanics.
This  project was created as part of Odin Project curriculum and as a major learning experience.

Features:
Slider to readjust size and reset the grid
3 color modes to paint the canvas with.


P.S Was very hard trying to figure out how to set the functionality of the color modes.
Learned alot with handling events and DOM Manipulation.
